 #Creating Command Line Utilities

#A Command Line Utility (CLI Tool) is a small program or script that can be run from the command line or a terminal, such as Windows CMD, Linux Terminal, or Mac Terminal.
#This means you can run a program by simply typing commands in the terminal instead of using a GUI (graphical interface).
#These tools are used to automate small tasks.
