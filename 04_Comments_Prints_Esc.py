#Escape Sequence

#\ (backslash) starts a special character
#The letter that comes after \ gives a special effect

print("Hello\nworld")
output:-
Hello

#IMP  why double \\?

the first \ is an escape character .
the second \ is treated as the actual backslash

so,python combines \\ into just \ in the result

================================================================================================================
#Print Statement
The print()function is used to display output .

print("Hello", "World", sep=", ", end="!\n")

    (You can use *sep* and *end* to modify the print output.")

 sep is used only between words.
 end is used only once at the end.
