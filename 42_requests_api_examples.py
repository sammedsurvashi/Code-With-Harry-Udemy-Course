#Requests Module - Working with APIs


1. What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a bridge that allows two applications to share and exchange data.

 Example:

Weather app → makes an API call to get the temperature from a weather server.
When you look up "weather in Pune," the app sends an API request and receives data in response.

2. What is the Requests Module?

Python's requests module allows us to receive and send data from web APIs.

We can send HTTP requests using::-

GET → to read data
POST → to send data
PUT → to update data
DELETE → to delete data
