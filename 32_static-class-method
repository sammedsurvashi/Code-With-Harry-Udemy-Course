#Static Method 
#A static method does not depend on any object (instance).
#It can be called directly using the class.
#It is created using the @staticmethod decorator.
#It is mainly used for calculation or utility functions.

class MathUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

#Called directly using class
print(MathUtils.add(5, 10))  # Output: 15
