#Static Method 
#A static method does not depend on any object (instance).
#It can be called directly using the class.
#It is created using the @staticmethod decorator.
#It is mainly used for calculation or utility functions.

class MathUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

#Called directly using class
print(MathUtils.add(5, 10))  # Output: 15

===========================================================================

#Class Method 
#A class method takes the class itself as the first argument (usually named cls).
#It can be called directly using the class, without creating an object.
#It is created using the @classmethod decorator.
#It is mainly used to modify class-level variables or properties.

class Student:
    school_name = "ADYPU"

    @classmethod
    def change_school(cls, new_name):
        cls.school_name = new_name

# Called directly using class
Student.change_school("Pune University")
print(Student.school_name)  # Output: Pune University
